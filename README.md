1. Upon opening the webpage a user should see a gameboard with 20 preloaded cards that all look the same and the cards should be laid out proportionately on the screen -Done 
2. On the back of the cards there should be an image that links a specific card to another card on the gameboard -Done

4. That card should remain revealed until a second card is selected and revealed as well  -Done
5. If a user matches 2 cards that are the same the user should be notified that they have found a match   -Done
6. If the user does not find a match both revealed cards should flip over and return to their preloaded state -Done
7. If a match is made the cards should be hidden from the user moving forward in the game  
8. Upon matching all cards and hiding them the user should see an alert that they have won and be able to click a button that will reset the gameboard  
9. The button should be loaded for the user at the button of the page to reset the gameboard to its originial state at anytime during or after the matching  -Done
10. Upon reseting the gameboard the order of the preloaded cards should be randomized for the user -Done
